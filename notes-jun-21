need to figure out how to apply the hover underline. should i have just done border? like bottom border? how to render component on hover
maybe use onMouseOver, and give it a handler. create new div, underneath the div.linkIndexBar, call it div.linkIndexBarHover,
onMouseOver={handleMouseOver} onMouseOut={handleMouseOut}
handleMouseOver={()=>linkIndexHover(true)}
handleMouseOut={()=>linkIndexHover(false)}
{linkIndexHover?div.linkIndexBarHover:null}

this project does not have consistent styling. might be an issue later. using state to keep track of mouse events vs just applying a hover css pseudoclass may complicate things in the future.

applied solution, works like a charm.

now i have to revise tablet breakouts. also going to check mobile version. hopefully its an easy fix.

destination mobile and tablet is broken
