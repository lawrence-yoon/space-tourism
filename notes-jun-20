ok so this project is mostly done now, just need to add

hover states to navbar buttons
selected link underlined
need to change the default hover over a link, to change into a hand
fix destination page? ive added divs and it really messed up mobile and tablet breakouts. maybe even just delete those two things and redo with grid...
i think that would be it. make sure all the breakouts work.
